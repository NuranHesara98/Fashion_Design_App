# OpenAI API Key Guide

## Current Issue
Your application is showing "No image was generated" because the OpenAI API is returning a `401 Incorrect API key` error. The API key format in your `.env` file is not valid for the OpenAI API.

## API Key Format
- Your current API key starts with `sk-proj-`, which is not a valid format for OpenAI API keys.
- Valid OpenAI API keys typically start with `sk-` followed by a string of characters.

## How to Fix

1. **Get a Valid API Key**:
   - Go to [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
   - Sign in to your OpenAI account
   - Create a new API key (or use an existing one)
   - Make sure it starts with `sk-` (not `sk-proj-`)

2. **Update Your .env File**:
   - Open your `.env` file
   - Replace the current `OPENAI_API_KEY` value with your new API key
   - Save the file

3. **Restart Your Server**:
   - After updating the API key, restart your server to apply the changes

## Testing
- After updating the API key, you can run the `check_api_key_format.js` script to verify that your API key is working correctly:
  ```
  node check_api_key_format.js
  ```

## Common Issues
- If you're using an organization ID, make sure to set it correctly in the OpenAI client configuration
- Ensure your OpenAI account has billing information set up
- Check that you have sufficient credits or balance for API usage

## API Key Security
- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Keep your API key secret and secure
- Consider using environment variables in production environments
